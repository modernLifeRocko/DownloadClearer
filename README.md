# Download directory cleaner
A CLI tool to deal with the mess that is my Downloads directory.
I'm running it on WSL to handle the Windows downloads.

## Usage
Clone the repo.
Rename .env_template to .env and write the corresponding paths to your case.
Run clearer.py
I make no assurances that it runs on your system.

## Known issues
Files with spaces in the name can't be moved (even after removing the spaces)
